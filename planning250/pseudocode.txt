Start program
Import random function
Introduction and instructions to play
Ask how many rounds the user would like to play (declare intRounds as the constant for the game)
	Loop rest of program using a counter for X rounds chosen
	Assign Rock, Paper, and Scissors to a number (Function maybe to call it?)
	Ask user to input Rock, Paper, Scissors (assign a number value to each to keep simple)
Have computer randomize between 3 choices (between the numbers assigned to Rock, Paper, Scissors,)
Use if/elif statements to decide who won
Nested if statement to decide if a point gets added
Move on to next round using a loop
Once X amount of rounds has been completed, end game loop
